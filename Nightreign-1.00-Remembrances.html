<h2>Wylder's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[101000] The Wylder tracked the Nightlord into the Lands Between. Having traversed the sea of fog, he was met with an endless downpour of Night and rain. His memories end abruptly, in an ambush by the Fell Omen. Waking in the ruins, he heard the voice of a woman in a white cloak. She told him he was in the Roundtable Hold, gathering place of champions. Only then did she introduce herself as the Priestess. Only then did she convey his duty—the slaying of the Nightlord. The Wylder made no response, gave no motion to accept or decline. Indeed, his purpose stood unchanged.</p>

<p>[101010] The Iron Menial made a single request of the Wylder; the procurement of a whetstone which would allow him to maintain the condemned's armaments. An abundance of mining tunnels can be found below the Lands Between, brimming with ores and minerals. Laying hands upon a whetstone in such a place should pose no problem. Though a trivial task, the Wylder did not think it right to refuse. He was indebted to the Roundtable, after all.</p>

<p>[101020] The Iron Menial accepted the whetstone with heartfelt thanks. From among the fine things offered to the Wylder as thanks, his eye was drawn to a single earring belonging to the Priestess, just recently mended. A theory already forming in his mind, he asked to borrow it. Holding the earring to the light, a pattern could be seen, along with the following words: "O mother grass and father cloud, be the fortitude which spurs us on our path." The very same message contained within the Wylder's own earring. Upon returning it to the Priestess, she let slip that its counterpart belonged to a brother whom she had never met.</p>

<p>[101030] A crypt appeared unheralded, right underneath the Roundtable Hold, in which slept denizens of a time long past. The Iron Menial explained that it was the site of an ancient ritual performed in order to beckon the minds of descendants to the Hold. He also let slip that the Priestess was a captive of the Roundtable. Pursuing the matter with her, she revealed that this was indeed the case, her exit from the place "forbidden." The Wylder knew then that he must act. The Recluse advised him to seek a silver tear, and the Iron Menial told him where to look—the Shrouded City of Noklateo.</p>

<p>[101040] Upon obtaining a silver tear, the Wylder made a pledge to the Duchess. That even if the road should be long and arduous, there was no choice but to walk it, if it meant that he might save her.</p>

<br>

<h2>Duchess's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[102000] The Duchess held in her hand the lost pocket watch. Unclasping the lid, her eyes were drawn to the inscription: "The sun will rise again." These were the words by which her adoptive family lived. Words which she could always draw upon on for courage. Even if she should stumble in the dark and find herself tumbled down into the very bowels of the earth, cold, frightened, and alone, she knew she only needed to look up, and light would guide her way back, sooner or later. The time had come to draw her blade once more.</p>

<p>[102010] The Raider spoke to the Duchess, worried about the Wylder. He said that the younger man seemed distant, not quite all there. The Raider ventured the idea that a routine task might help, and suggested the Duchess seek out some materials needed to help the Wylder keep his weaponry in good working order, as he was always absent-mindedly going about the task anyway. The Duchess had noticed from the scent of his armaments that the Wylder preferred to use an oil derived from flora to keep his blades free of rust. It was likely she could find such plantlife in the Lands Between.</p>

<p>[102020] The Wylder took the golden tear from the Duchess, and the Raider expressed his thanks. The Revenant summoned the Duchess, wishing to speak in a place where curious ears could not listen in. "The Wylder won't remain among the living much longer." As a living soul in a body inanimate, she could see the presence of life wherever it resided. The Iron Menial meanwhile reminded her that she had resolved to stay the path until the Nightlord was slain; that to do any less would be to waste every sacrifice already made. The Duchess's hand tightened into a fist.</p>

<p>[102030] An appetite-rousing aroma was drifting in from somewhere within the Roundtable Hold. As if beckoned by the source of the scent, she roamed the Hold until she found it—a freshly cooked meal. Before she could stop herself she had already tasted of the bread. She was greeted by a flavor she had known since her earliest days. The Wylder, who had been sleeping nearby, awoke at some point and told her it was a recipe he had learned from his mother. The Duchess knew in that instant, that the flavor was not just similar, but precisely the same as the one she knew from childhood. She saw then that the Wylder was her older brother.</p>

<p>[102040] The Duchess was at a loss. Should the Nightlord be defeated the Wylder would be damned. But to let the Nightlord live would be to spit in the eye of all that had been accomplished thus far. Though yet grappling with her own thoughts, the Duchess had discovered the last words of Weathervane, the Raider's former comrade. Upon hearing them, he felt as if he had been set free. Why choose one path over another, when both can be taken? Plainly exasperated, the Revenant challenged the Duchess to a duel. Upon her knees in defeat, the living doll expressed herself plainly, reminding the Duchess of her strength and her duty as Priestess. The Duchess reflected on the wisdom shared by her two companions.</p>

<p>[102050] The Duchess handed a blessing to the Iron Menial. Such that the mechanical contraption could pull the Wylder back from the abyss. The Duchess, speaking frankly with the Wylder, affirmed his resolve to defeat the Nightlord. Perhaps she needed to hear those words directly. Perhaps she needed to make herself remember. Finally looking ahead, there was set within her hair the one thing she had ever stolen for herself, a small but precious object taken from her older brother.</p>

<br>

<h2>Raider's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[103000] People might sow the fields, reap the harvest, and cross the seas to trade. Sometimes, weapon in hand, they might protect themselves, or plunder from others. It was all the same to the Raider; each was simply a means to live on. Fortunately for the man, he was blessed with might. With his great frame and reliable brawn came confidence and victories aplenty. It's no surprise he began to believe his worth was proven through feats of strength. Something drew the hulking man to these lands, an expectation, perhaps a hope, that the worthy foes he had been searching for awaited him here.</p>

<p>[103010] A tall stone monument had been erected at the back of the gardens. The Iron Menial explained that it presented a record of rituals held; glorious battles in which one would face their fated foe. Touching the stone monument afterwards, it began to glow brighter and brighter. Finally, it launched a beacon of light into the sky, deafening like a firecracker as it burst. Seemingly thrilled by these events, the Iron Menial announced "The Tourney of the Lands Between has begun."</p>

<p>[103020] The winner of the first match appeared in front of the stone monument. The braided cord the Raider had found seemed to intrigue the Iron Menial, who was offering his congratulations, so he handed it over before leaving to seek his next match. However, as he approached, the monument remained silent. There was no choice but to wait.</p>

<p>[103030] The Iron Menial approached the Raider, quietly broaching the topic of the braided cord. He was certain it had once belonged to the famed pirate known as the "White Horn." According to the histories the Iron Menial had read, this character had a rival known as the "Black Claw," and though the two often fought, neither could claim true victory over the other. Surmising from the horns ornamenting the Raider's helm that he was the storied White Horn, the Iron Menial expressed his excitement to discover the grand conclusion to the rivalry between the two great seafarers. The mountain of a man said nothing, but flashed his teeth before making his way towards his next battle.</p>

<p>[103040] With the Raider's next victory, the stone monument fell silent once more. Turning away from the stone, the Iron Menial met the Raider's gaze and said that his next opponent had forfeited the match. "What could possibly be happening?" Perhaps the fated foe simply could not be found... Perhaps whatever drew the pair together was not potent enough? All the Raider could do was wait.</p>

<p>[103050] The Raider emerged victorious. The rivalry between the White Horn and the Black Claw was finally settled. To the Raider, who had clashed with his rival time and time again, each fight reaffirming the great might of both combatants, he was the worthiest of foes. But now, their competition had reached its conclusion. Upon his humble grave, the Raider rested his long cherished helm and cloak, revealing the great black clawmark upon his back. He gazed upon the grave with a feeling not unlike satisfaction.</p>

<br>

<h2>Executor's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[104000] A roving warrior from a land to the distant east, the Executor held a deep regard for the natural world, with a particular reverence for flowers, whose sole and rooted purpose is survival and propagation. He gives shape to his reverence through brush and ink. Upon his journey's end, he looked up at the skies of the Lands Between, lost for words at the sight of the transcendent Erdtree. In gratitude, he hoped he might lay his life down before this grand spiritual marvel. It was then that he noticed. The power of the crucible of life had found purchase within him, with its roots in the primordial origins of the Erdtree. The Executor pondered the meaning.</p>

<p>[104010] The Guardian, fond of the arts, approached the Executor. He expressed that as a knight who had never known the Erdtree, but having been deeply moved by the representations he had seen, he wished to gaze upon it with his own two eyes one day. Later, called upon by the Priestess, she asked him to find for her some flowers, blessed with the Grace of Gold. The Executor was glad to oblige.</p>

<p>[104020] With the blessed flowers in hand, the Executor visited the gardens. The flowers, cared for by the Iron Menial, were resplendent in full bloom. Sensing a kindred spirit in the Executor, the servant suggested he paint the scene before him. Settling down before his easel, he felt something in the air. As he turned to look behind him, a presence seemed to speak; "The Erdtree is no more." But when he looked, whomever had spoken was now gone. After telling the Priestess he had given the flowers to the Iron Menial, she relayed to him a growing danger—the Grace of the Roundtable Hold was ebbing away, and the Executor's help was needed.</p>

<p>[104030] The light of the Great Site of Grace was feeble and "fading fast," according to the Priestess, who feared what this might mean for their mission. She suggested they attempt to augment their remaining Grace, relying on the Executor's memories to locate golden seeds. The Executor did not hesitate to assent. The voice came to him one more, declaring it "...pitiful, to cling to such an impossible hope."</p>

<p>[104040] Each time the Priestess offered the hidden radiance of a golden seed to the greater blessing the former glory of the site of Grace would flicker back for a moment, but just as soon be lost again. "That's that" sighed the Priestess, lowering her hands with a despondent look, for she knew what it meant; their purpose must be expedited. They would have to slay the Nightlord even sooner than anticipated. Playing upon the Executor's unease, once again came the voice: "After failing to return to the roots, your cursed frame was beholden to hope, and that only worsened the pain."</p>

<p>[104050] As if she had received divine revelation, the Priestess relayed to the Executor that a golden seed had begun to sprout atop a frigid mountain summit. Unable to ignore her sliver of hope, the Executor set off towards the snow-covered lands.</p>

<p>[104060] The golden sprout shone with majestic Grace, bathing the surroundings in its light. Opening his eyes, the Executor saw the Erdtree of yore towering above, and then the owner of that familiar voice, stood atop the cliff, his sword pointed right at him. Defeated in their duel, the phantom spoke a few choice words to the Executor, "Live, without averting your gaze." With the greater blessing restored to the Roundtable Hold, the Priestess met him with heartfelt thanks. The Erdtree would be recovered. All hope is not lost. However, from within the memory he saw within the light, the wound to his stomach had been seared into his mind. The Executor once again took up brush and ink, that he might uncover its meaning.</p>

<br>

<h2>Recluse's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[105000] The Recluse hails from a long-lived race from a bygone age, whose inky black skin and prowess with curse magic made them feared as living deities. Her encounter with the denizen of the land of Gold was nothing more than coincidence. The Recluse found them collapsed, lost in the forest in which she lived, and helped them recover. As thanks, the denizen presented her with a tree branch that glistened with light. Much time had passed since the Recluse had hidden herself away from the world. She tended to the branch, and from it grew a guiding light. This was her chance—she might find her there. She departed for the Lands Between.</p>

<p>[105010] The Iron Menial reproached the Recluse for her bearing. He told her that there were whispers—that she didn't seem entirely trustworthy. To vanquish these doubts he asked her to defeat enemies tainted by Night. The Recluse listened amicably, thinking this would be the perfect chance to begin her work. She handed over a fragment of something, calling it evidence, to the Iron Menial. Apologizing, he agreed to help find the person for whom she searched. The Iron Menial suggested the Recluse use the study to collect her thoughts about the investigation, where she could record and review the clues thus far collected.</p>

<p>[105020] The girl had always been drawn to the strong. In her brilliance she held only the highest expectations for herself, right until she fell in battle. If she had lived on, she would surely have been fascinated by the Night. The three-headed beast was mantled with a distinct strand of the Night's power. Such creatures unfailingly appear at the intensest extremes of battle, raring to fight, causing the Recluse to suspect there was more to them than met the eye. First, she would need to test her theory.</p>

<p>[105030] She'd had the right idea all along—the power of Night displayed qualities all too similar to an ancient magic. It felt intimate, nostalgic, even personal to her... The girl was close by, she was certain. The Recluse had gathered everything she needed to make her deduction—the girl was hiding in the Roundtable. Certain she was waiting for her chance to have her reunion, the Recluse resolved to give her exactly what she wished for.</p>

<p>[105040] The Witch of the Wheel had disguised herself as the Iron Menial. The old acquaintances began to talk of their former days, spent in service to the kingdom. One of the witches lost their life to break the deadlock in their kingdom’s war, though was revived through an encounter with a certain infant that would become the Nightlord. The Witch of the Wheel put a stop to the Recluse's pursuit of the Nightlord. She revealed the Iron Menial's whereabouts, as it to give her pause. When the Recluse woke him, and a strange object slid off his frame—a stone, received from the Nightlord in a dream. He entrusted it to her, that it might serve in the looming final hour. Thoughts swirling in her mind, the Recluse began to ponder...</p>

<br>

<h2>Ironeye's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[106000] Even among the shadowy operators of the black markets, a group purported to be especially talented in the act of killing could be found. Known only as "The Fellowship," a name that struck fear even in the hearts of hardened evildoers. The Ironeye was searching for a traitor. Having taken his mission from the Fellowship, he traced his quarry to the Lands Between. Though his target was one of his own, the orders were absolute. He knew the cruelty of the world all too well. Diligently gathering intelligence, working towards his goal, it seemed a job like any other.</p>

<p>[106010] The Priestess had commissioned the Ironeye several times before. They both had their reasons for wanting to find the traitor; a secret which now bound them together. This time, the Priestess asked the Ironeye to kill the carriers of a plague that had been quietly spreading across the Lands Between, sowing yellow chaos through the realm. The Ironeye accepted. He would find and kill these foes—the first step on the path that would lead to his ultimate quarry.</p>

<p>[106020] For fulfilling his duties, the Priestess offered the Ironeye a reward. Taking it, he made his own offering; an arrowhead. He explained; it was part of an arrow favored by a fallen archer known as the "monster." A man who had undergone the same instruction as him, but had become obsessed with the act of killing. He theorized this man was somewhere in the Lands Between. Furthermore, this "monster" was a traitor to the Fellowship. They both had the same thought. They exchanged a glance, speaking volumes.</p>

<p>[106030] The Ironeye undertook another request from the Priestess. The target was a shadow which wore his own face. Upon finishing the job, he found a letter. Breaking the seal, he took out the short message, which read: "When the Nightlord nears, meet at the Roundtable." The Ironeye could not help but recall his brief encounter with the man of prodigious might during his training at the Fellowship. And the cold of the fire that burned in his eyes. The fated hour would not be long.</p>

<p>[106040] A man was in the crypt below the Roundtable. It was the monster, not long for this world. He welcomed the Ironeye's unwavering blade as it bit into his neck. The regret upon his face was plain as he came back to life. "Find an Edge of Order," he bade. He seemed more than anything, to be in pain. He seemed small.</p>

<p>[106050] With an Edge of Order in hand, the Ironeye came to see the traitor again. The monster looked more alive than ever as he met the blade. There would be no more secrets as he spoke his final words; "You and I, all of us, are already dead. But our curse does not allow us to rest. As Those Who Live in Death, we could not rest until the Nightlord was defeated." An end that seemed all too quick for such a monster. Having concluded his duties, all the Ironeye could do was look down at the unmoving thing before him.</p>

<p>[106060] On the verge of the ritual's completion, having felled the Nightlord, the Ironeye pressed the dagger's silver edge against the wrinkled man's neck before wrenching it free in one fluid motion. Taking only a single glance at the spreading pool of blood, he stood up, turned, and walked once more the path he knew all-too-well. A cold fire burned in his eyes.</p>

<br>

<h2>Guardian's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[107000] The Guardian was keen to learn. After leaving the defeated army, it was knowledge that he needed to restore his broken homeland. The knight's eyes shone; the Roundtable Hold contained a wealth of histories and records for his perusal. But first and foremost, he was a warrior; he could not begin to tackle such a task alone. Sympathetic to his desire to learn, the Recluse offered to lend her aid. There was a spring in the Guardian's step as he headed over to her, abuzz at what lessons would be his to discover.</p>

<p>[107010] The Recluse asked the Guardian to ponder the sudden disappearance of a group of pilgrims. Though he made his answer, the Recluse would not affirm or deny his conjecture. Taking his cue to ask the Iron Menial, he too seemed to know more than he would say, and suggested the Guardian visit a certain church. It seemed like the lesson was one that could only be learned through practical experience. The Guardian headed to the house of worship.</p>

<p>[107020] The Guardian found a well-loved plaything among the Rotted. Upon showing it to the Recluse, she revealed the last of the tale. The group of pilgrims had continued to travel with the infant child, despite its infection with scarlet rot. In the end, the rot claimed them all. The Recluse advised the Guardian, who valued his flock above all else, that protection alone cannot grant salvation. For the sake of saving an individual, could he sacrifice his allies? The Guardian knew not the right of it.</p>

<p>[107030] The Raider, who smelled of booze even more than usual, stopped the Guardian, saying he had a gift for him. He laid a helmet on the table, mended by his own hand. Tentatively, the Guardian reached for it. His heart began to pound, sweat running down his face. From somewhere, he heard the clashing of steel upon steel, the bellowing of battle, the screaming agony of comrades slain. His flock would be all but wiped out soon enough. Eventually, coming to his senses, he saw that the helmet had been knocked to the floor. He confessed an unbearable truth to the Iron Menial; that he was the sole survivor of a horror. The menial seemed to know that an accursed weapon known as an "Ictarus" was responsible. The Guardian believed that if he knew the thing responsible for clipping his peoples' wings, he might be able to atone somehow. He resolved to assemble tomes which might teach him about the weapon.</p>

<p>[107040] Using the key taken from the Guardian Golem, the Iron Menial was able to release the ancient binding upon the second volume of the collection, which had been given by the Recluse. Ictarus weapons, invented for use in a certain war, were said to be imbued with a curse that twisted the very life of living creatures. The book offered no details pertaining to their origin, however. The Guardian had no choice but to search for the remaining tome, in the hope that it would offer the answers he seeks.</p>

<p>[107050] A strange merchant of nebulous origin had found his way into the Roundtable Hold. The apparitional man offered talismanic charms, saying he wished to be of service to the braves trying to overcome the threat to the Lands Between. The Guardian, suddenly woozy, collapsed. He reawoke in bed, apparently seen to by his companions. It was then he noticed the Recluse and the Iron Menial. As he rose, the Recluse told him that the charms handed out by the merchant were imbued with a curse. "What if it had happened in the midst of battle," she mused. Blood running cold at the thought of such a thing happening to his comrades, the Guardian's eyes sharpened.</p>

<p>[107060] From the ledger left by the merchant, the Guardian found that he had traded goods with a demon. After some negotiation, the third and final volume chronicling the accursed Ictarus was his. "The curse was symbolic of the sorcery of a distant land. Writ in a script put down in blood." Suspicion roiled inside the Guardian. A person sprang to mind; perhaps a truth from which he wished he could avert his eyes. The knight of the Pinionfolk's footfalls rang heavily as he made his way to the one responsible for his people's plight.</p>

<p>[107070] The Guardian pressed the Recluse. She acknowledged her role in events and assented to his judgment, in whatever form it might take. Though she was his ally, fighting the very same cause, she was also the bringer of irredeemable tragedy unto his flock. There she was, right in front of him. The Guardian would have to make his choice.</p>

<p>[107080] Judgment had been passed upon the Recluse. In the end, the Guardian could not bring himself to harm her. Though he said nothing, the Recluse knew what he was thinking; that even though she was the one responsible for the loss of his old flock, she was now very much a part of his current one. He chose what was best for the here and now—he had determined where his principles lay, as a knight. Now, there was nothing left to fear. The knight of the Pinionfolk took the helm that had lain so long unworn in hand and made his first step forward.</p>

<br>

<h2>Revenant's Remembrance</h2>

<p>[108000] It happened upon a stormy night. Smashing plates, screams, and hurried footsteps rang throughout the mansion. The servants were killing one another. Sacrifices were made, for the girl. A man who had accompanied the attacking hoodlums, gave his life for her. Another was struck down from behind, putting himself between the girl and blade pointed at her. The man who had shown her where to hide, and then used his own body to block the way. And after all the sacrifices, the girl fell herself, to a fiend's blade. The sun shone down upon the quiet mansion when the doll awoke that morning. On the verge of dying, the girl had attempted a rite of transmigration. Now stood the Revenant, who would have her vengeance upon the Night.</p>

<p>[108010] In search of the Nightlord, she wandered. Until eventually, losing sight of her purpose, she was swallowed by the Night. The Priestess and Iron Menial, who had welcomed her into the Roundtable Hold, seemed untroubled by the fact that she had once been swallowed by the Night. But not everyone presented the same attitude to her. The Guardian, rational as ever, proposed the Revenant perform a task to earn the trust of her new allies. She would have to acquire a weapon used by a minion of Night. The Revenant, understanding the position of one who could not afford to write off a potential ally, had no choice but to accept.</p>

<p>[108020] The Revenant handed over the fragment of blade to the Guardian. The knight of the Pinionfolk seemed happier to welcome her as an ally than he was with the success of her quest. Though this reaction made the Revenant furrow her brow somewhat, the Guardian didn't seem to take offense.</p>

<p>[108030] The Wylder spoke plainly, fearing the Revenant's changing form could become a danger to the Roundtable. Just as it was told, there was something unusual happening to the doll's frame, which bore dark discolorations of resistance. The Revenant could sense that it was because she was now resisting the Night she had once accepted. The sweetness she remembered from before was an ever-present temptation now, but still, she remained firm of will. Worried about her outward appearance, the Iron Menial wanted to touch up her cosmetics. The Revenant silently assented.</p>

<p>[108040] Though hidden with make-up, the Duchess had noticed the worsening of the discoloration. The Revenant pointed out that a similar mark had appeared on the Duchess's own face, which appeared lost in thought. Though surprised, she calmly conjectured that there was a contamination spreading through the Revenant's body. Through amplified sensitivity of the nerves, delicate changes could be felt. Thus it could be concluded that the marks were indicative of the power of the Night's influence over its wielders. Fearful she might be swallowed again by the Night, the Duchess suggested the Revenant seek the help of the Recluse. The witch, who seemed unperturbed in the slightest, invited her to sit down upon a bench.</p>

<p>[108050] The Revenant entered the dream again. She was assailed by an even greater nightmare. Having risen to the challenge, the memories she had sealed away came flooding out. The doll saw the girl as she fell to the fiend's blade. The girl had loved her doll, and the doll in turn had loved the girl. As such, the doll rose, leaving the mansion behind. Waking from her dream, she was able to answer the Recluse's question. She would bury the Nightlord. The doll, given life by the Night itself, swore anew that she would take her vengeance.</p>
