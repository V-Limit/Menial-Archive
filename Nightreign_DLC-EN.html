<p>[40] A Scenic Flatstone yet to be polished.</p>
<p>Purchase to reveal its precious gift.</p>
<p>N.B. Yields items from up to ver. 1.02 of the game.</p>
<p>This piece was chosen for its remarkable size.</p>
<p>[70] A Deep Scenic Flatstone yet to be polished.</p>
<p>[2070] The will of the Harmonia, left upon their defeat.</p>
<p>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite.</p>
<p>A tiny farming village was besieged by bandits, who proceeded to ravage both its plots and people.</p>
<p>A young village girl, seeking help, dashed into the forest, where she prayed to the statue of a protective deity that held a weapon raised overhead.</p>
<p>By the end the village was steeped in red and settled in silence. The village girl, drenched in blood, stood with a vacant stare and a heroic weapon in her grip.</p>
<p>[2071] An inhuman will, left in the wake of battle.</p>
<p>[2080] The night belonging to Straghess, left upon its defeat.</p>
<p>The traces left behind by countless battles were pelted by rains, transported by muddy streams, and collected in deposits.</p>
<p>This mixture of remorse, desperation, and sorrow eventually formed legs, stood of its own accord, and finally, voiced a curse that would be its mantra.</p>
<p>"Smash, smash, smash the Night..."</p>
<p>[19000] Fast-acting medicine for a disease that afflicted the Albinaurics that works by removing invasive contaminants.</p>
<p>The vassal who developed the medicine did so by testing it on his own body. It was successful, and used to treat patients, but the vassal himself passed, his sickness already too advanced.</p>
<p>Both the disease and the cure are not mentioned in the annals of history, and the person responsible for their omission is unknown.</p>
<p>[19001] A note left by the Scholar addressed to those in pursuit of the truth, summarizing the events that transpired in Limveld.</p>
<p>"Analysis can be painful, but the benefit outweighs the sacrifice.</p>
<p>To whomever succeeds me in my work: May your endless journeys lead to enlightenment."</p>
<p>[19050] A well-worn leather case for storing a monocle. The scuffs and crease marks are proof of its owner's adoration.</p>
<p>The Scholar left evidence of his own death to the Undertaker. It was the always-candid Scholar's form of a farewell.</p>
<p>"Now...what do I do?"</p>
<p>[19051] A string threaded through a crystal corroded by Night. Inside are the floating, wavering signs of Night.</p>
<p>The power exuded by the necklace is meager but stable. Grasping it gives its owner an uncanny sense of calm.</p>
<p>The promise gave her purpose. And made it possible to hold on to the necklace.</p>

<p>[8500] A finger torn from the Primordial Nightlord. Lacking the life-giving spark of blood, it is instead saturated with Night.</p>
<p>The Undertaker held a faint glimmer of hope. That she might finally shed the dreadful power that enshrouds her.</p>
<p>But she knew her hopes were only fantasies. And so she became determined to at least find comfort.</p>
<p>The Night was brought to an end, but the loathsome hex would be hers forever.</p>

<p>Still pumping despite its detachment, its flesh writhes with desire for a new host.</p>
<p>The core is undeniable evidence that the Scholar is an entirely different form of life.</p>
<p>[10001002] A wondrously clear crystal received from the Scholar. Inside are the floating, wavering signs of Night.</p>
<p>The spread of the blotches has neatly ceased, as if the crystal has found its peace.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no longer anything to fear. Presuming his words can be trusted.</p>
<p>[10001003] A journal written by a man who served the royal family</p>

<p>MEDICINEALBINAURICS</p>
<p>[10001005] A small leather case for storing the Scholar's monocle. Handed to the Undertaker, and later returned.</p>
<p>When the case was handed back to him, it reminded him of his mentor's words, spoken to him on the day that the monocle was first given to him to take on his travels.</p>
<p>"This lens reveals the truth."</p>
<p>[10001006] A headband worn by the denizens of the lands of Gold. This commonplace accessory in the Lands Between signifies one's faith and gratitude for the Grace of Gold.</p>
<p>The Scholar was certain of the purpose that lay before him. To weave the past into being.</p>
<p>[10001007] A note left by the Scholar for someone, intended to summarize the events that transpired in Limveld.</p>
<p>Normally he would have taken the notes back himself, but the subtle smile on his wrinkled face betrayed the impossibility of such a wish.</p>

<h2>PersonalScenarioBody_dlc01.fmg</h2>
<p>[107051] This is a memory of the new flock.</p>
<p>While in the study, in wafted the alluring savor of freshly-baked bread. The taciturn warrior must have been in a mind to cook.</p>
<p>Led by the aroma in the courtyard, the pirate's bellowing laughter rang out. The archer had an arrow aimed at the big man. The Guardian had no mind to stop their amusement, for he knew they were merely making merry. The swordsman said not a word, and headed to his easel.</p>
<p>Upon entering the chapel, he saw the sister, hands clasped together. Meanwhile the man of learning pored over his books, tea in hand.</p>
<p>They were a flock that was far from whole, imbalanced and uneven. He wondered if the word even truly applied.</p>
<p>It was around that time that the unfamiliar merchant arrived.</p>
<p>[109000] A journal entry titled "To Distant Limveld."</p>
<p>Crossing the storm-tossed seas, I reached the land of my ancestors. According to my documents, there is an academy in which the great sage Hierodas passed down his knowledge—he for whom our institution is named.</p>
<p>But what I seek above all else is the Cleansing Tear. There is a line concerning it found in a collection of folk tales I read back in the institution that I cannot help but dwell upon.</p>
<p>"The Cleansing Tear is our desire manifest—that which will save our kind from its fate."</p>
<p>It can be found here, in this land, I am certain. The gate hidden in the fog has opened. I will draw the truth into the light, at last.</p>
<p>[109010] A journal entry titled "A Lens to Look into the Past."</p>
<p>The enchanted monocle I carry was given to me by my mentor as I embarked upon this quest. It is invaluable to my analyses.</p>
<p>The glintstone brings various facets of the object into focus. By unspooling the memories buried within the object, the events of the past can be witnessed.</p>
<p>A process which must be performed with care. I shall verify these truths myself, such that no harm comes to the relationships I have built with others.</p>
<p>I write this record of my actions with those same ideals in mind.</p>
<p>[109020] A journal entry titled "The Vestiges Surrounding the Cleansing Tear."</p>
<p>I found a scrap of paper I believe to have been carried by a messenger. Though soiled and in poor condition, I saw faintly but unmistakably the word "tear" imprinted upon it.</p>
<p>Examining it further, I heard the most intriguing words arise from within the vision I beheld...</p>
<p>"The tear... Salvation..."</p>
<p>This warrants further analysis. I shall continue my probe of the phantom vision as usual.</p>
<p>[109030] A journal entry titled "The Albinaurics' Secret Elixir."</p>
<p>I discovered a nobleman's diary in a study hidden beneath a marsh. Deciphering it affirmed the connection between the Cleansing Tear and the Albinaurics.</p>
<p>The vision also pointed to a place known as the Research Annexe. Could it be there that we, the Albinaurics, find our manifest desire and reclaim our fate?</p>
<p>An additional observation:</p>
<p>A fellow warrior of the Roundtable Hold was exhibiting some strange behaviour. It seemed she wished to escape the notice of the others, and so, with proof of my claim in hand, I made her a proposal that should serve us both.</p>
<p>I had been deliberating how to frame such a long disappearance from the Roundtable Hold, but now I have my answer. I leave the rest to her.</p>
<p>[109040] A journal entry titled "The Trader of the Roundtable Hold."</p>
<p>With scant clues, the Research Annexe, the nobleman's second residence located below Limveld, was near impossible to find without the Priestess' help. I thought of the peculiar being who seems to come and go from the Roundtable Hold at its leisure. I explained my purposes to it and struck a bargain with the small jar merchant.</p>
<p>I communicated via etchings on wax tablet, and the merchant responded gleefully. After an exchange of drawings, we concluded with a detailed agreement. All that was left was to wait. Before long, everything was ready. The truth would soon be revealed. With my heart aflutter, I packed a few belongings and went to the merchant.</p>
<p>[109050] A journal entry titled "The Truth of the Cleansing Tear."</p>
<p>What remains of this entry has been crossed out so many times it has become completely illegible.</p>
<p>The majority of it has been torn out completely.</p>
<p>[109060] A journal entry titled "That Which I Dreamt While Asleep."</p>
<p>In deepest darkness was I lying down, adrift in a small boat that was barely large enough to contain me in width or length. The sky above too was black as pitch, and though there was nothing at all to mark my passage, no land nor shore in sight, still I felt the rocking of the vessel as it drifted down the stream.</p>
<p>Just then the little boat creaked as someone stopped it dead. I tried to crane my neck to see but my body would not move. All I saw was a hand clasped upon the vessel as it pushed me gently out.</p>
<p>"Cast hatred aside. Heed not the call of the broken and discarded..."</p>
<p>White flowers bloomed on the riverbank, and a sweet scent not unlike honey wafted gently. </p>
<p>...I began to wonder what became of the woman with whom I had made the bargain with. I wish I could give her the crystal I found underground to show her my appreciation.</p>
<p>[109070] A journal entry titled "A Sentimental Reawakening at the Roundtable Hold."</p>
<p>My memories returned in vivid clarity after my reawakening at the Roundtable. I have known this uncanny sensation in my frame before—this feeling that my body had been lost. Once I was able to move my arms and legs, I finally stood up.</p>
<p>I asked the Iron Menial who had come to my aid—he responded by indicating the flower sitting at my bedside. Its white petals swayed gently, exuding a uniquely refined aroma.</p>
<p>I must speak to her, it seems. There is no need to keep the bargain anymore.</p>
<p>[109080] A journal entry titled "My Purpose."</p>
<p>Limveld is a sacred land under which sleep secrets and mysteries aplenty. What I have unearthed will change our understanding entirely, for I have found that which before was only known to us in books and legends.</p>
<p>I know I will be called a madman, a liar, or worse, but I hope that those who follow in my footsteps will be that much closer to the truth.</p>
<p>Allow me to conclude my findings, having now come to the end of this grand romance.</p>
<p>The Cleansing Tear is not a manifestation of our desires—it has not the power to change our fate. It is however, an artifact of great import—let it be known to history.</p>
<p>[109100] A sky of clouds. In the distance the sun breaks through, only to disappear again.</p>
<p>"Go. To the place where they await you. Only there will you find your salvation."</p>
<p>The father told me that those were the words of our God. I think he was seizing an opportunity to be rid of me.</p>
<p>Loathsome thing that I am, I do not fault him for it.</p>
<p>[109110] A sky of clouds. They seem to be making their way across the sky with greater speed than usual.</p>
<p>My whole life has been a loathsome affair. I have no parents or family to call my own. At the monastery, the other children shunned me, as did the adults. I hunted beasts in the woods, partook of their flesh and blood, and was feared.</p>
<p>As I grew I learned that my constitution required a constant stream of power to consume. Once, I tried to resist, but the shakes and pain became unbearable. As the delirium reached its zenith, I had bitten my own arm without knowing.</p>
<p>Living was hard, but choosing death was unthinkable. Since then, I have lived the span of many lives.</p>
<p>Yet nobody understands me.</p>
<p>I remain alone.</p>
<p>[109120] A sky of clouds. The foaming waves appear darkest gray.</p>
<p>The power of Night spreads across the land. To me it feels like a blessing and a curse. Its taste is bitter, and it makes me nauseous. Yet somehow it soothes my ever-churning mind.</p>
<p>I wonder, will I change too, if I overcome this Night? What if I remain the same... I don't want to relinquish this power the Night has brought...</p>
<p>Ah, that reminds me. I believe the Iron Menial said he had an important task for me, today.</p>
<p>[109130] A sky of clouds. Humid and stifling.</p>
<p>He saw me...</p>
<p>I'm lucky it was only the Scholar. He can be trusted. As long as I do as he says, it will all be fine...</p>
<p>I'm also having hallucinations, as if everyone were frightened of me. I'm starting to believe it might be true. I feel sick. The melancholy is growing to be too much.</p>
<p>But when I clutch the leather case I was given, it grants me respite from my thoughts.</p>
<p>[109140] A sky of clouds. Seabirds sing in the distance.</p>
<p>It's been several days since the Scholar disappeared from the Roundtable Hold. He must have been serious...</p>
<p>The Priestess is trying to gather information as to his whereabouts. She believed him dedicated to her cause—his sudden absence puzzles her. Rare though it is, this is not the first time a Nightfarer has disappeared.</p>
<p>All I can do is remain true to our bargain.</p>
<p>[109150] A sky of clouds. The wind is strong.</p>
<p>The Scholar has returned. I'm surprised he has regained his form considering what he was reduced to...</p>
<p>As I wiped my mouth of the stains of Night, I began to ponder. Was I attempting to atone for my sins? I cannot say for certain. He knew my secret, perhaps I was simply scared.</p>
<p>Though I failed to uphold my promise, he chose me a second time—I can only assume he saw some use in me yet.</p>
<p>I feel a calmness when holding the glass he gave me. Perhaps this will help me overcome the hunger. Without feasting on the succor of Night.</p>
<p>[109160] A sky of clouds. A few rays of sunlight peek through.</p>
<p>My life had been a loathsome affair.</p>
<p>Those around me kept their distance as I moved from place to place. At times I was pressed into battle, and piled the corpses high.</p>
<p>What could be a path to peace had been offered to me, and the sacrifices would be worth it.</p>
<p>For me, with little else but bloodshed to call a talent, perhaps I had found my purpose.</p>
<p>I have come to believe it is, now.</p>

<p>[20100000] The odious thirst of vengeance...</p>
<p>[20100010] We must bring an end to it ourselves...</p>
<p>[20100020] Curse this Dreglord.</p>
<p>[20110000] Another substantial threat subdued.</p>
<p>[20110010] Perhaps this was an act of penance.</p>
<p>[20110020] We are condemned, after all.</p>
<p>[102200000] I wonder if the Dreglord has any relation to the Night at all...</p>
<p>[102200010] Regardless, it is a threat we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>[102201000] The Dreglord's very existence, it's entirely beyond reason...</p>
<p>[102201010] It is...unsettling...</p>
<p>[102202000] It seems you encountered the Dreglord once before.</p>
<p>[102202010] How should we even begin to seek the signs to guide us...</p>
<p>[102202020] Our rediscovered allies encountered the Dreglord once before.</p>
<p>[102203000] We have found the lost signs that lead to the Dreglord.</p>
<p>[102203010] Proof above all else that it is our enemy.</p>
<p>[102210000] I know not where the Scholar can be found.</p>
<p>[102210010] Though I heard you were the last to see him.</p>
<p>[102210020] Do you have any idea at all?</p>
<p>[102211000] Even the smallest lead could prove helpful.</p>
<p>[102212010] I see. Apologies if I overstepped my bounds.</p>
<p>[102213000] I can't believe it. Another warrior, lost...</p>
<p>[102214000] It seems I spoke too soon—he's alive and well.</p>
<p>[102214010] I'm glad to have been mistaken!</p>
<p>[109000000] What's wrong? You appear surprised.</p>
<p>[109000010] Ah—our link became quite tenuous for a moment.</p>
<p>[109000020] But here we are. As good as new.</p>
<p>[109000030] I'm at your service, once again.</p>
<p>[109001000] The Dreglord...</p>
<p>[109001010] Truth be told, we know very little.</p>
<p>[109001020] Only that this threat, this distortion, is distinct from the Nightlord.</p>
<p>[109002000] Even in its nascent state, we could not defeat it.</p>
<p>[109002010] But we must not let it roam free.</p>
<p>[109002020] It seems the world faces more than one threat.</p>
<p>[109003000] It is only because of its nascent state that we were able to defeat it.</p>
<p>[109003010] This is a fragile victory at best.</p>
<p>[109003020] To achieve a lasting peace, we must bring an end to the Night.</p>
<p>[109004000] Its whereabouts are unknown. And it seems all signs are lost.</p>
<p>[109004010] But if I may dare to conjecture...</p>
<p>[109004020] I believe that when greater shifts occur, our path will once again become clear.</p>
<p>[109004030] Such as the defeat of a Nightlord. That just may do the trick.</p>
<p>[109005000] And now the Dreglord reveals itself.</p>
<p>[109005010] A mass of the flesh, blood, and souls of the fallen.</p>
<p>[109005020] Bound together in the form of the Dreglord, whose stature rivals even that of the Nightlord.</p>
<p>[109005030] Had you not heard? Of the odious thirst for vengeance, the determination of a wounded soul.</p>
<p>[109005040] When morality and reason are surely cast aside.</p>
<p>[109005050] And such a force, driven by a singular will, does not rest until it is made whole.</p>
<p>[109005060] We must bring an end to it ourselves.</p>
<p>[109006000] There are still no signs.</p>
<p>[109006010] But what of the sudden appearance of the Balancers?</p>
<p>[109006020] As if to admonish the very acts we engage in.</p>
<p>[109006030] Fanciful, perhaps, but alas I cannot rid myself of the notion...</p>
<p>[109007000] No matter in the least.</p>
<p>[109008000] Until we meet again.</p>
<p>[109009000] Goodbye for now.</p>
<p>[109010000] How might I assist you?</p>
<p>[109011000] This is a welcome change of pace.</p>
<p>[109012000] Would you care for a tea?</p>
<p>[109013000] The enemy's waves of attack are short-lived.</p>
<p>[109013010] Consider it an opportunity to ply the full measure of your craft.</p>
<p>[109014000] An aberration swallowing an entire landform...</p>
<p>[109014010] Dreamworthy subject matter for any scholar...</p>
<p>[109015000] Perhaps I'd do better with a thrusting sword?</p>
<p>[109015010] Oh, it's for my own peace of mind, really.</p>
<p>[109016000] The Lords have assembled, but there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>[109016010] Remember. Even gods have weaknesses.</p>
<p>[109017000] The scenes within relics conjure a myriad of emotions.</p>
<p>[109017010] Perhaps they were fleeting visions seen in battle?</p>
<p>[109018000] I have learned much from every one of your stories.</p>
<p>[109018010] Perhaps I should not say so, but to me this is a wonderful opportunity.</p>
<p>[109019000] It seems that the Primordial Nightlord is indeed the true root of Night.</p>
<p>[109019010] Our efforts will not be for naught. We are so very close to victory.</p>
<p>[109020000] I never expected to set foot in the domain of my forebears while I still drew breath.</p>
<p>[109020010] I thank the stars for this chance.</p>
<p>[109021000] Now I've set eyes upon things that were only known to me in books.</p>
<p>[109021010] As our forebears did for us, I will share their stories with those who shall follow.</p>
<p>[109021020] No matter what.</p>
<p>[109022000] How can you keep your eyes on the enemy without losing your footing?</p>
<p>[109022010] Well, I believe it can be done through selective use of your tools.</p>
<p>[109023000] I'm afraid we've been a terrible burden to you.</p>
<p>[109023010] How about a pot of tea? My finest blend, of course.</p>
<p>[109024000] Still more training? I am quite astonished by your vigour.</p>
<p>[109024010] No word of a lie. I truly mean it!</p>
<p>[109025000] Your ideas never fail to turn things on their head.</p>
<p>[109025010] You'd be a boon to any academic circle, I'd wager.</p>
<p>[109100000] We are equals, and as such I cannot force you, but, would you indulge me in something?</p>
<p>[109100010] I intend to leave the Roundtable Hold.</p>
<p>[109100020] I've located the thing I am looking for. It is not far, in fact.</p>
<p>[109100030] But I do not wish to be an imposition. I need you to tell everyone...</p>
<p>[109100040] That I died...and did not reawaken.</p>
<p>[109100050] To lend weight to your claim, I give you this.</p>
<p>[109100060] You are the only one I dare depend on.</p>
<p>[109101000] Tell everyone that I died...and did not reawaken.</p>
<p>[109102000] What a mess I've made.</p>
<p>[109102010] My little fib almost came true! Ha ha!</p>
<p>[109102020] But, it was not for naught. Here.</p>
<p>[109103000] I took the liberty of delving into your background.</p>
<p>[109103010] The curse that binds you...is the need to claim strength as payment for your own.</p>
<p>[109103020] This is a crystal found below Limveld.</p>
<p>[109103030] A special object that yields power by catalysing one's thoughts.</p>
<p>[109103040] Most of them were ruined through exposure to the Night,</p>
<p>[109103050] but this crystal is stabilised, churned by Night to a state of equilibrium.</p>
<p>[109103060] It's not much, but it will sate your thirst.</p>
<p>[109104000] This endeavour has proved meaningful to me, as well.</p>
<p>[109104010] I wish to save this world. And I want to share the truth with my old friends.</p>
<p>[109104020] To that end, please indulge me once more.</p>
<p>[109104030] Please, stand witness to our legacy.</p>
<p>[109104040] I don't know when the chance will come. But one day my kind will ask you for answers.</p>
<p>[109108000] Why, yes, the great noise caught my attention.</p>
<p>[109109000] Ngh...</p>
<p>[109110000] How very odd... I was just thinking of you.</p>
<p>[109110010] I'll be fine, now that you have the core.</p>
<p>[110000010] Forgive me. What do you need?</p>
<p>[110000020] I will fight, when the time comes.</p>
<p>[110001000] I imagine this was once a chapel.</p>
<p>[110001010] But now it's little more than a storecupboard for the Scholar's possessions.</p>
<p>[110001020] Do you think it blasphemous? Well...</p>
<p>[110001030] I'm far worse—I pray to a god about whom I know nothing.</p>
<p>[110002000] The Dreglord... I suppose it must be fate at work again.</p>
<p>[110002010] It is...a great heap of cast-away things. The aftermath of the long night...</p>
<p>[110002020] In this land now spilling over with rubble and dead.</p>
<p>[110002030] But my opinion counts for little in this matter.</p>
<p>[110002040] The corpses are piled high—a truth undeniable. We are duty-bound to act.</p>
<p>[110002050] There is no other choice.</p>
<p>[110003000] Understood.</p>
<p>[110005000] Blessing upon you.</p>
<p>[110006000] Yes, I'm listening.</p>
<p>[110007000] Must it really be me?</p>
<p>[110008000] I am not capable of taking your confession, if that is your hope.</p>
<p>[110009000] The beast's weapons are its legs and teeth—that which it uses to pounce and bite.</p>
<p>[110009010] Try to remain behind the creature, if you do not wish to be taken by surprise.</p>
<p>[110010000] I wonder... When the dawn breaks, will everyone truly be saved, or...?</p>
<p>[110011000] Leave the hammer to me.</p>
<p>[110011010] I'm used to wielding one when clearing up, after all.</p>
<p>[110012000] So many Nightlords...</p>
<p>[110012010] We'll just have to take them one by one...</p>
<p>[110013000] Night encroaches upon even our Roundtable Hold...</p>
<p>[110013010] I sense it whenever I gaze upon the light of this abundant grace.</p>
<p>[110014000] What a peculiar bunch we are...</p>
<p>[110014010] And I am treated like any other, despite what I am.</p>
<p>[110015000] Is this the final challenge we now face?</p>
<p>[110015010] I dearly hope so...</p>
<p>[110016000] It was but short, though it seemed like an eternity...</p>
<p>[110016010] I thank you for your kindness.</p>
<p>[110017000] I doubt I shall ever forget what happened here.</p>
<p>[110017010] Nor the role I was entrusted.</p>
<p>[110018000] Make sure you know when to call it a day out there...</p>
<p>[110018010] Ah, pardon the unsolicited advice...</p>
<p>[110019000] Your fallen feathers...I've been keeping them.</p>
<p>[110019010] They're very warm, and soothing...</p>
<p>[110020000] Oh, I'm so sorry...I was transfixed...</p>
<p>[110020010] I've never seen a doll of such size and captivating detail before...</p>
<p>[110021010] I wonder if I could attain your calm, if I were to take up the brush...</p>
<p>[110101000] I couldn't keep my promise...</p>
<p>[110101010] But... It's nowt to do with me...</p>
<p>[110101030] I don't like this...</p>
<p>[110102000] This will do... I'm sure.</p>
<p>[110201000] Ah!</p>
<p>[110202000] Umm...</p>
<p>[110203000] Thank you, for what you did earlier.</p>
<p>[110205000] Yes? What is it...?</p>
<p>[110206010] I... I see...</p>
<p>[110206020] But... I've never really made a promise before...</p>
<p>[110207000] You must have your reasons...</p>
<p>[110207010] I shall trust in your judgement.</p>
<p>[110207020] Though... I've never really made a promise before...</p>
<p>[110208000] It was nothing but chance...</p>
<p>[110208010] I only sought you out because I couldn't trust you. </p>
<p>[110208020] I didn't think for a moment that revival was on the cards...</p>
<p>[110208030] But never mind that—I don't need to hold on to this anymore. Please, have it back.</p>
<p>[110209000] Are you...angry with me?</p>
<p>[110210000] You are angry with me, aren't you...?</p>
<p>[110211000] How is that body of yours bearing up?</p>
<p>[110213000] Yes? How can I help?</p>
<p>[110214000] Ah, that's a little...</p>
<p>[110215010] Very well...</p>
<p>[110216000] This time I will ensure my promise is kept.</p>
<p>[110216010] Perhaps you should resume your work?</p>
<p>[110217000] Ah...</p>
<p>[110218000] What...?</p>

<p>[309200000] Brave champion, if I may?</p>
<p>[309200010] I have a message from the small jar merchant.</p>
<p>[309200020] "There's something in here, I can hear it! Please, I can't take it anymore..."</p>
<p>[309200030] That is all.</p>
<p>[309200040] Would you mind seeing to it? We all rely upon its services, after all.</p>
<p>[309201000] Oh my, you're soaked through again...</p>
<p>[309201010] Perhaps you might like to dry off by the fire and... Goodness! How did you do that so quickly?!</p>
<p>[309202000] Your piercing insight makes me a little nervous to tell the truth...</p>
<p>[309202010] Not that I have anything to hide, but... Please, don't go too rough on me!</p>
<p>[309210000] Ah, there you are.</p>
<p>[309210010] There's something I must relay to you.</p>
<p>[309211000] The Nightfarers came together to slay the Night...</p>
<p>[309211010] But you... You cannot maintain your strength unless you partake of it...</p>
<p>[309211020] I understood this well enough, however...</p>
<p>[309211030] You have overindulged, and now you are no different from the Night itself.</p>
<p>[309211040] As such... You cannot be permitted to live!</p>
<p>[309212000] You have overindulged in the Night.</p>
<p>[309212010] So you must die!</p>
<p>[309213000] Ngh... What have you done...? The Night must be slain...</p>
<p>[309213010] Everyone... Please, you must kill...this foe!</p>
<p>[309214000] Ahh... How vexing... Why do you refuse to die?</p>
<p>[309215000] As long as monsters like you remain, the Night will never end...</p>
<p>[309216000] If only the fool would die... It would be a gift to us all...</p>
<p>[309217000] Be a good girl and die, you...blockhead! Die!</p>
<p>[309218000] Please! Stop!</p>
<p>[309219000] Have you managed to calm yourself?</p>
<p>[309219010] ...I'm glad. I thought you might have gone plumb mad, brave champion.</p>
<p>[309219020] But now all is well. I managed to get through to you. This is a place of safety.</p>
<p>[309219030] Please, be at your leisure. I'll be over yonder, should you have any need of me.</p>
<p>[309220000] You plan to search for the Scholar?</p>
<p>[309220010] Ahh, you feel compelled to act, I can see it in your eye.</p>
<p>[309220020] In which case, I bear good tidings—</p>
<p>[309220030] A new kind of Shifting Earth phenomenon has occurred.</p>
<p>[309220040] The Scholar will have headed there, I am certain.</p>
<p>[309221000] A new kind of Shifting Earth—the Great Hollow...</p>
<p>[309221010] A subterranean space in which Limveld's secrets slumber, so it is said.</p>
<p>[309221020] I urge you take all due caution.</p>
<p>[309222000] I am delighted to hear that the Scholar has been found.</p>
<p>[309223000] The signs that led to the Dreglord only appeared once. A rather unique phenomenon...</p>
<p>[309223010] Most peculiar...</p>
<p>[309224000] The war we wage has awoken the Dreglord...</p>
<p>[309224010] I wonder...did we once know this, too?</p>
<p>[309225000] Do you need anything else?</p>
<p>[309226000] What's the matter, brave champion?</p>
<p>[309227000] Brave champion! Are you hurt?</p>
<p>[309228000] Very good, I'm glad to hear it.</p>
<p>[309228010] Could it have been a cave-in? I'll check the other rooms.</p>
<p>[309229000] Hmm. No trouble here, as far as I can see...</p>
<p>[320000000] ...It might just...it might just be his salvation...</p>
<p>[320000010] ...I am certain the Cleansing Tear is no mere fable...</p>
<p>[320000020] ...Let's go...to meet with the noble...below the fort...</p>
<p>[320001000] ...Killing him will not turn back the clock...</p>
<p>[320001010] ...The Albinaurics' secret elixir...the Cleansing Tear...must be guarded at all costs...</p>
<p>[320001020] ...I must reach the Research Annexe...</p>
<p>[320002010] ...I pray that this will suffice... Your Majesty...</p>
<p>[320003000] ...This lens reveals the truth.</p>
<p>[320004000] To whoever shared this blood, though I know not which age you've traveled from...</p>
<p>[320004010] Cast hatred aside. Heed not the call of the broken and discarded...</p>
