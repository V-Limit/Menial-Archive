<p>The strange taste of this night was all too lonely, and more vast than it could ever know.<p>
<p>[2031] The dark night belonging to Maris, left upon its defeat.<p>

<p>[2040] The night belonging to Libra, left upon its defeat.<p>
<p>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite.<p>
<p>The demon was obsessed with the concepts of impartiality, fairness, and equanimity. For anything to reach a higher plane each side must elevate the other.<p>
<p>The goat-eyed being gazed into the darkness. If it is true, that the night swallows all, then the night is impartial. The night is a thing of fairness, of equanimity. The night is a champion of balance.<p>

<p>[2050] The night belonging to Fulghor, left upon his defeat.<p>
<p>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite.<p>
<p>The left arm of the loyal and brave servant of the gods had been severed from behind. As he turned back to look, he fell to despair.<p>

<p>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite.<p>
<p>From the phantasmal peak upon which she hid herself, she peered down into the world, committing to memory what she perceived. Then, her eye drawn to a certain cataclysm, from out of hiding she leapt with wings unfurled.<p>
<p>For she wished to know and to understand, first hand, just what fortunes and misfortunes the disaster would bring upon the world.<p>

<p>[2100] The night belonging to Heolstor, left upon its defeat.<p>
<p>The power of its namesake can be unlocked by performing a relic rite.<p>
<p>The country lay in ruin. The man who once was knight had challenged the hero, but he too was no match. He fell, just another body in a great pile.<p>
<p>But eventually he awoke, crawling out from underneath the others. Though he had failed to protect anything or anyone, he yet lived. And so he cursed the world.<p>
<p>It was the dead of night, and from the sky poured down a great rain.<p>
<p>[10000] A well-kept antique pocketwatch engraved with an intricate design, likely a prized possession.<p>
<p>The influence of the encroaching Night clung to the expecting woman, preventing her from ever giving birth. The only means to break it meant the sacrifice of her life.<p>
<p>But the curse of Night lived on, in both the orphan and in this keepsake, whose hands tell only twisted time.<p>
<p>This dark power is both a badge of lost innocence, and the very thing that allows its owner to fight back.<p>
<p>[10001] A small frame that is missing its picture. Whatever precious memory it once enshrined, now is home only to dust and grime.<p>
<p>A voice is heard that beckons one to seek the owner.<p>
<p>"Peer into this window, and revisit the first glimpse of night..."<p>
<p>[10002] A fetish bathed in golden magic.<p>
<p>Shackles were used to bind the accursed people called the Omen, and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under strictest confinement.<p>
<p>But the magic has long faded, leaving only a dark stain in its wake.<p>
<p>The protector of gold yet stands guard over the realm, even after being swallowed by Night.<p>
<p>[11000] A natural whetstone of high quality with a fine grain. A precious sharpening stone mined in Limveld.<p>
<p>The clash with Night has spanned eons. And yet now, precious little time remains.<p>
<p>[11001] A single earring belonging to the Wylder. Rusted and encrusted with grime.<p>
<p>Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light.<p>
<p>A relic of the Lord who lumbered ever onward, clutching tight this single ornament.<p>
<p>[11002] A kernel of life that straddles the living and inanimate. Also known as a Larval Tear.<p>
<p>Once, in the Lands Between, it was said to have granted one a new form.<p>
<p>[12000] Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west.<p>
<p>An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus.<p>
<p>"The blades shared an identical engraving. A symbol of the sorcery of a distant land. A script put down in blood."<p>
<p>[12001] A stone stake that opens a sealed-away lock.<p>
<p>Crafted by an ancient civilization and claimed from a Guardian Golem.<p>
<p>Still imbued with an old yet fading magic. Can open locks sealed in a similar manner to the golem.<p>
<p>[12002] A brooch imbued with potent magic, made from the blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>At first, this magic brooch, with its aura of unknowable power, was intended as a ceremonial tool to calm violent winds. But the war, for better or worse, demanded that it be employed otherwise, as a magic artifact to bring a swift end to the conflict.<p>
<p>[12003] A cracked brooch, bereft of its former magic. A blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>The Guardian smashed the jewel at the core of this magic implement. To think it was once a mere ceremonial tool to calm violent winds.<p>
<p>[13000] A finely-crafted streamlined arrowhead. Used by sellswords of the Fellowship.<p>
<p>Said to be the choice weapon of the Monster, an inhuman assassin. A single word is written on each arrow, and when an arrow deals a death blow, the word becomes the epitaph of the fallen.<p>
<p>To this day, the Monster lurks somewhere, unseen and unknown.<p>
<p>[13001] Sealing wax removed from an opened letter. Used by sellswords of the Fellowship.<p>
<p>The stamp signifies an assassin's oath. Once a target is agreed upon, there is no going back.<p>
<p>Such contracts are said to have their origin in the Lands Between.<p>
<p>[13002] A fragment of the spear of Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow. Imbued with holy essence through battles in Limveld.<p>
<p>Can briefly, and only with very limited potency, grant its power to other armaments.<p>
<p>When Those Who Live in Death are felled by the Order, they will never rise again.<p>
<p>[14000] Liquid plant extract that is highly effective at repairing armaments. Harvested in indeterminate locations across the Lands Between, but only by those who are aware of its useful properties.<p>
<p>This viscous oil can be extracted by squeezing the flower, seeds and all. Some call the liquid golden dew, owing to its lustrous yellow hue.<p>
<p>[14001] A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl. An extra decoration for the Revenant's garb.<p>
<p>The silver shines with a brilliance that is both ceremonial and dignified.<p>
<p>It recalls the girl's words.<p>
<p>"With strength comes the burden of duty."<p>
<p>[14002] An iron coin imbued with a small blessing by the priestess. Emits a faint warmth.<p>
<p>The girl made a wish to the mechanical doll... That a blessing would reach him—a blessing that could open the eyes of one who is already dead but refuses to accept it.<p>
<p>[15000] A torn magic-warding braided cord. Worn by warriors for good luck on the eve of battle.<p>
<p>The distinctive stone clasp suggests that it belonged to glory-seeking pirates.<p>
<p>The legends surrounding the competing seafaring factions, who divided the seas into east and west, have been spoken of for generations in places near and far.<p>
<p>[15002] A necklace made from a thick rugged claw, with a shining black luster that instils fear in any who gaze upon it.<p>
<p>Long ago, the Raider fought the king of the archipelago forest. He grappled the hulking beast with his iron grip, and flung him away, proving his strength. He claimed the king's broken claw as a trophy and testament to his victory.<p>
<p>For a time, the Raider devoted himself to exploits on the high seas, but he tired of the unending struggle that never seemed to determine a clear victor. And so, he delivered the claw to his arch nemesis as an invitation to duel to the death.<p>
<p>[16000] A blade fragment imbued with the power of Night. Crystals have formed on the broken edge.<p>
<p>The dark substance slowly spread, as if to restore the lost portion of the blade, or to sharpen the existing blade beyond its natural properties.<p>
<p>[16001] Tool for accentuating the beauty of people and things. One of the Iron Menial's favorite items.<p>
<p>Though plain it is a reliable tool, with a soft-bristled brush that delicately applies ceruse to skin or other surfaces.<p>
<p>"Your beauty deserves nothing less."<p>
<p>[16002] An intricate painting of a girl of pure heart and an elderly companion that conveys both trust and affection.<p>
<p>On that night, the doll understood—the young girl wished to live. And with that understanding, the doll found her purpose.<p>
<p>On the back of the painting is a hurriedly scrawled, fading message.<p>
<p>"Chloe, seek happiness, for you deserve it more than anyone."<p>
<p>[17000] A crystallized form of the power of Night. A strange, translucent thing with a corrosive shadow that appears to writhe.<p>
<p>The reach of the Night is limitless; its potential, immeasurable. Its touch indiscriminate, affecting any and all things. Whether one fears the Night, or welcomes it, depends upon the manner of contact.<p>
<p>But as for the Night, here and now, it is the unquestioned enemy of the Condemned.<p>
<p>[17001] A clear sign of the Nightlord's presence, in the form of a terribly tattered rag.<p>
<p>Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible.<p>
<p>The menial asked about an engraving. But how did he know there was one, before setting eyes upon it?<p>
<p>[17002] A disturbing stone with a distinct lifelessness.<p>
<p>The bone of an outer god with the power to expunge divine essence, but that can also be destroyed by the same essence.<p>
<p>The choice was left to the witch. As per the wishes of the one who bestowed it.<p>
<p>[18000] Altus flowers flush with nutrients and grace. Before, such flowers were commonplace on the Altus Plateau.<p>
<p>The vibrant hues suggest that the flowers received plenty of sunlight, and appear to shine in an ode to the resplendent Erdtree.<p>
<p>[18001] A golden seed that has exhausted its grace. Such seeds were once found at the base of illusory trees.<p>
<p>The seed was sapped of its grace by the priestess, but not entirely. Although very little remains, its grace will one day return, like trees that grow back in a celebration of life.<p>
<p>[18002] A golden seed harboring a warm blessing. This one was found on a steep and snowy peak.<p>
<p>This seed sprouted despite the harshness of its environment, like youthful potential blossoming in the crucible of adversity. <p>
<p>Or, what may be called a miracle.<p>

<p>[192] A Great Rune of the shardbearer Radahn.<p>
<p>Its blessing raises maximum HP, FP and Stamina.<p>
<p>Radahn was amongst the children of Rennala and Radagon, who became demigod stepchildren after Radagon's union with Queen Marika.<p>
<p>The Great Rune burns, to resist the encroachment of the scarlet rot.<p>
<p>[193] A Great Rune of the shardbearer Morgott.<p>
<p>Its blessing greatly raises maximum HP.<p>

<p>[195] A Great Rune of the shardbearer Mohg.<p>
<p>Its blessing grants a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms, and imparts a Phantom Great Rune upon successful invasion.<p>
<p>Mohg and Morgott are twin brothers, and their Great Runes are naturally similar.<p>
<p>But Mohg's rune is soaked in accursed blood, from his devout love for the wretched mire that he was born into far below the earth.<p>
<p>[196] A Great Rune of the shardbearer Malenia.<p>
<p>The blessing of this half-rotted rune reduces the healing power of Flask of Crimson Tears.<p>
<p>And yet, due to the infusion of Malenia's spirit of resistance, attacks made immediately after receiving damage will partially recover HP.<p>
<p>Malenia is daughter to Queen Marika and Radagon, and her Great Rune should have been the most sacred of all.<p>

<p>You'll find it easy to summon other players at these locations, as co-op and hostile summoning signs created with small effigies gather at summoning pools.<p>
<p>[9127] You must be near a rebirth monument to summon spirits from ashes.<p>

<p>Found near bodies of water close to Minor Erdtrees.<p>
<p>The light of fireflies is believed to have an alluring magic. Golden light is considered to invite runes.<p>
<p>[20812] A firefly whose glowing tail has hardened into<p>
<p>glintstone, widely found in Liurnia Lake.<p>
<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Alas, now that its tail is glintstone,<p>
<p>it can no longer beguile potential mates.<p>
<p>[20820] The golden, desiccated remains of a centipede.<p>

<p>[20830] Someone's excrement. It has a golden tinge.<p>
<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Often hidden in woods and thickets.<p>
<p>Gold-tinged excrement is a highly stable substance; it doesn't dry out, nor does it lose its customary warmth or scent. For better or for worse, it remains as it is.<p>
<p>[20831] The bloody excrement of a carnivorous beast.<p>
<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Found in the land of the new dynasty.<p>

<p>Material used in crafting items.<p>
<p>A fundamental ingredient for medicinal boluses.<p>
<p>[20841] Faintly luminescent moss that grows in dark caves, speckled with tiny, yellow flowers.<p>

<p>It is primarily used in perfumes.<p>
<p>[20842] Faintly luminescent moss that grows in dark caves, laced with fine crystals.<p>

<p>[20845] An ember taken from the eye socket of a corpse.<p>
<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>

<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Found on Mt. Gelmir.<p>
<p>[20852] Rock formed from solidified giant ant venom. Highly acidic. Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Found near Ainsel River and other places where giant ants live.<p>
<p>[20855] A small clump of sharp, pointed stones.<p>
<p>Material used for crafting items.<p>
<p>Such compound stones, found in lands once beset by ancient dragons, are said to be the scales of those very beasts.<p>
<p>[1000000] A natural whetstone of high quality with a fine grain. A precious sharpening stone mined in Limveld.<p>
<p>The clash with Night has spanned eons. And yet now, precious little time remains.<p>
<p>[1000001] A kernel of life that straddles the living and inanimate. Also known as a Larval Tear.<p>
<p>Once, in the Lands Between, it was said to have granted one a new form.<p>
<p>[1000002] Liquid plant extract that is highly effective at repairing armaments. Harvested in indeterminate locations across the Lands Between, but only by those who are aware of its useful properties.<p>
<p>This viscous oil can be extracted by squeezing the flower, seeds and all. Some call the liquid golden dew, owing to its lustrous yellow hue.<p>
<p>[1000003] The dying words of the apprentice Weathervane, addressed to a former mate.<p>
<p>"Cap'n, I've found a wind that carries me farther, faster."<p>
<p>Weathervane's fascinations changed like the days of the week, to the chagrin of the single-minded crew. But not being one for regrets, the first mate was unperturbed by what others said.<p>
<p>Going by the self-appointed title of "apprentice of a great pirate," Weathervane found that dreams could come true, even if they might take a lifetime.<p>
<p>No wonder she so cherished the wind.<p>
<p>[1000004] Altus flowers flush with nutrients and grace. Before, such flowers were commonplace on the Altus Plateau.<p>
<p>The vibrant hues suggest that the flowers received plenty of sunlight, and appear to shine in an ode to the resplendent Erdtree.<p>
<p>[1000005] A golden seed, found at the base of an illusory tree.<p>
<p>When the Elden Ring was shattered, these seeds flew from the Erdtree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew that its end had come.<p>
<p>[1000006] A golden seed harboring a warm blessing. This one was found on a steep and snowy peak.<p>
<p>This seed sprouted despite the harshness of its environment, like youthful potential blossoming in the crucible of adversity. <p>
<p>Or, what may be called a miracle.<p>
<p>[1000007] A crystallized form of the power of Night.<p>
<p>Though translucent, there is shadow-like patterning. Seemingly the traces of something eating away at it.<p>
<p>The reach of the Night is limitless; its potential, immeasurable. Its touch indiscriminate, affecting any and all things. Whether one fears the Night, or welcomes it, depends upon the manner of contact.<p>
<p>The breath of the Night rises and falls within this shard, ready to answer that which seeks to touch it.<p>
<p>[1000008] A clear sign of the Nightlord's presence, in the form of a terribly tattered rag.<p>
<p>Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible.<p>
<p>And yet a lingering magic recalls something familiar. As if the impressed seal is being held intact by someone in mortal fear of the light's annulment.<p>
<p>[1000009] A finely-crafted streamlined arrowhead.<p>
<p>Used by sellswords of the Fellowship.<p>
<p>Said to be the choice weapon of the Monster, an inhuman assassin. A single word is written on each arrow, and when an arrow deals a death blow, the word becomes the epitaph of the fallen.<p>
<p>To this day, the Monster lurks somewhere, unseen and unknown.<p>
<p>[1000010] An invitation from the traitor, sealed with the stamp of an assassin's contract.<p>
<p>Inside the envelope, a single folded page contains a short message.<p>
<p>"When the Nightlord nears, meet at the Roundtable."<p>
<p>The Monster was aware of a looming threat, and welcomed the assassin Ironeye.<p>
<p>[1000011] A fragment of the spear of Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow. Imbued with holy essence through battles in Limveld.<p>
<p>Can briefly, and only with very limited potency, grant its power to other armaments.<p>
<p>When Those Who Live in Death are felled by the Order, they will never rise again.<p>
<p>[1000012] A doll that appears to have been adored by a young child. The doll's rough cloth is stained with rotting flesh and blood.<p>
<p>Worn thin, as if it were held tightly all too often.<p>
<p>[1000013] A stone stake that opens a sealed-away lock.<p>
<p>Crafted by an ancient civilization and claimed from a Guardian Golem.<p>
<p>Still imbued with an old yet fading magic. Can open locks sealed in a similar manner to the golem.<p>
<p>[1000014] Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west.<p>
<p>An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus.<p>
<p>"The blades shared an identical engraving. A symbol of the sorcery of a distant land. A script put down in blood."<p>
<p>[1000015] A brooch imbued with potent magic, made from the blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>At first, this magic brooch, with its aura of unknowable power, was intended as a ceremonial tool to calm violent winds. But the war, for better or worse, demanded that it be employed otherwise, as a magic artifact to bring a swift end to the conflict.<p>
<p>[1000016] A blade fragment imbued with the power of Night. Crystals have formed on the broken edge.<p>
<p>The dark substance slowly spreads, as if to restore the lost portion of the blade, or to sharpen the existing blade beyond its natural properties.<p>
<p>[1000017] Power of Night that failed to acquire a host.<p>
<p>Droplets that sought to intermingle, and gathered in anticipation of a fitting host's welcome, only to be abandoned.<p>
<p>Desire finds its way through a back door, and longing reveals one's true nature. Little doll, how long can you continue to resist?<p>
<p>[1000018] With its pin repaired, this earring has been fully restored.<p>
<p>Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light.<p>
<p>Closely resembles one owned by the Wylder.<p>
<p>[1000019] Iron coins of a faraway land received from the Wylder.<p>
<p>A nomadic tribe used these coins in trades with settled tribes to purchase supplies to support their isolated lifestyle.<p>
<p>These coins, produced from the Wylder's pocket, are icily cold.<p>
<p>[1000020] A hand-crafted charm that is somehow unsettling. A gift from the apparitional merchant.<p>
<p>Crafted in an unrehearsed, imitative manner, judging by the frayed fabric and numerous loose strings.<p>
<p>Yet a charm is a charm, no matter the appearance.<p>
<p>[1000021] A dubious ledger used by a merchant, filled to the margins with detailed records of transactions.<p>
<p>A recent bold entry stands out.<p>
<p>"Ancient annals - Conveyed to a demon"<p>
<p>[1000022] A torn magic-warding braided cord. Worn by warriors for good luck on the eve of battle.<p>
<p>The distinctive stone clasp suggests that it belonged to glory-seeking pirates.<p>
<p>The legends surrounding the competing seafaring factions, who divided the seas into east and west, have been spoken of for generations in places near and far.<p>
<p>[1000024] A necklace made from a thick rugged claw, with a shining black luster that instils fear in any who gaze upon it. Long ago, the Raider fought the king of the archipelago forest. He grappled the hulking beast with his iron grip, and flung him away, proving his strength. He claimed the king's broken claw as a trophy and testament to his victory.<p>
<p>For a time, the Raider devoted himself to exploits on the high seas, but he tired of the unending struggle that never seemed to determine a clear victor. And so, he delivered the claw to his arch nemesis as an invitation to duel to the death.<p>
<p>[1000025] A coin from a former age received from a burly man. Treasure chests, brimming with such coins, are the stuff of pirates' dreams.<p>
<p>Originally minted with imprints on both sides, the ornamentation has long since vanished owing to the covetous rubbing of thick-knuckled fingers.<p>
<p>The coin recalls the man's worldly wisdom.<p>
<p>"It's your journey. Take all the paths you like."<p>
<p>[1000026] A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl. An extra decoration for the Revenant's garb.<p>
<p>The silver shines with a brilliance that is both ceremonial and dignified.<p>
<p>It recalls the girl's words.<p>
<p>"With strength comes the burden of duty."<p>
<p>[1000027] Flatbread with a rich aroma offered by the Wylder.<p>
<p>The traditional food of a nomadic tribe from a distant, vast grassland, passed down from mother to son.<p>
<p>"I know this.<p>
<p>The gently sweet and salty<p>
<p>flavor of this pita."<p>
<p>[1000028] Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west.<p>
<p>An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus.<p>
<p>"The blade leaves a wound that can never heal, owing to an ancient curse with the power to twist life. A frightful weapon concocted by a master of curses, under contract to an army determined to achieve victory."<p>
<p>[1000030] A scrap of paper with a note on the White Horn, part of a legend of the coastal waters, written by a certain first mate.<p>
<p>"Two seafarers, one from the west and the other from the east, were once locked in a fierce competition for influence. The White Horn ruled the west waters, while the Black Claw presided over the eastern seas.<p>
<p>Upon the shore did they contend for seven days and seven nights to see which was the stronger. While each fought bravely, a clear victor felt undeterminable."<p>
<p>[1000031] An iron coin imbued with a small blessing by the priestess. Emits a faint warmth.<p>
<p>The blessing would surely become a beacon to guide its bearer to its former owner.<p>
<p>That it might save the dear brother who would be facing death in the world outside. With that wish, so was it endowed. To one who could not be said to be truly alive, but all the same was surely called a friend.<p>
<p>[1000032] A cracked brooch, bereft of its former magic. A blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>The Guardian smashed the jewel at the core of this magic implement. To think it was once a mere ceremonial tool to calm violent winds.<p>
<p>[1000033] A small key featuring fine ornamentation. A fine work of craft made by Gillian, the Duchess' steward and de facto patron.<p>
<p>The Duchess once lived under the Viscount's roof, where she applied herself as a virtuous thief. She locked the tools of her trade inside a box of prized possessions, which she hid in a dim cellar.<p>
<p>This practice has not changed since coming to the Roundtable Hold. She yet keeps her secrets safe from prying eyes, concealing them in darkened corners.<p>
<p>[1000034] A scrap of paper detailing the "New Night" written in the tongue of an ancient people. The passage, torn from its former binding, reads:<p>
<p>"The Priestess is the very cornerstone of the Roundtable—indispensable. Should the Nightlord fall, the Roundtable too will crumble, as their fates are together bound.<p>
<p>Yet should the Roundtable be remade, perhaps the Priestess may be emancipated from her bindings.<p>
<p>This might be done upon the falling of the "New Night," should the Lord's power be lost. And if so..."<p>
<p>[1000035] A single earring belonging to the Wylder. Rusted and encrusted with grime.<p>
<p>Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light.<p>
<p>This appears to be one of a pair.<p>
<p>[1000100] A thing with the properties of a Great Rune harbored by the Primordial Nightlord.<p>
<p>The cutting-gifted tribe anticipated the coming night, and spent many a moon planning its prevention, concluding that their only chance at success was to cheat a god.<p>
<p>They had glimpsed what they should not; the very sin of the Erdtree. For their trespass, so were they punished.<p>
<p>[1000101] The qualities of the Nightlord, bearing the manifest potential to alter fate itself.<p>
<p>The light dimly reveals the contours—of a greater being that lies beyond the Nightlord.<p>

<p>﻿<p>
<p>PermanentBuffCaption.fmg<p>
<p>[120300] Cheat death a single time<p>
<p>[120301] Depleted until next contact with grace<p>
<p>[1000000] A natural whetstone of high quality with a fine grain. A precious sharpening stone mined in Limveld.<p>
<p>The clash with Night has spanned eons. And yet now, precious little time remains.<p>
<p>[1000001] A kernel of life that straddles the living and inanimate. Also known as a Larval Tear.<p>
<p>Once, in the Lands Between, it was said to have granted one a new form.<p>
<p>[1000002] Liquid plant extract that is highly effective at repairing armaments. Harvested in indeterminate locations across the Lands Between, but only by those who are aware of its useful properties.<p>
<p>This viscous oil can be extracted by squeezing the flower, seeds and all. Some call the liquid golden dew, owing to its lustrous yellow hue.<p>
<p>[1000003] The dying words of the apprentice Weathervane, addressed to a former mate.<p>
<p>"Cap'n, I've found a wind that carries me farther, faster."<p>
<p>Weathervane's fascinations changed like the days of the week, to the chagrin of the single-minded crew. But not being one for regrets, the first mate was unperturbed by what others said.<p>
<p>Going by the self-appointed title of "apprentice of a great pirate," Weathervane found that dreams could come true, even if they might take a lifetime.<p>
<p>No wonder she so cherished the wind.<p>
<p>[1000004] Altus flowers flush with nutrients and grace. Before, such flowers were commonplace on the Altus Plateau.<p>
<p>The vibrant hues suggest that the flowers received plenty of sunlight, and appear to shine in an ode to the resplendent Erdtree.<p>
<p>[1000005] A golden seed, found at the base of an illusory tree.<p>
<p>When the Elden Ring was shattered, these seeds flew from the Erdtree, scattering across the various lands, as if life itself knew that its end had come.<p>
<p>[1000006] A golden seed harboring a warm blessing. This one was found on a steep and snowy peak.<p>
<p>This seed sprouted despite the harshness of its environment, like youthful potential blossoming in the crucible of adversity. <p>
<p>Or, what may be called a miracle.<p>
<p>[1000007] A crystallized form of the power of Night.<p>
<p>Though translucent, there is shadow-like patterning. Seemingly the traces of something eating away at it.<p>
<p>The reach of the Night is limitless; its potential, immeasurable. Its touch indiscriminate, affecting any and all things. Whether one fears the Night, or welcomes it, depends upon the manner of contact.<p>
<p>The breath of the Night rises and falls within this shard, ready to answer that which seeks to touch it.<p>
<p>[1000008] A clear sign of the Nightlord's presence, in the form of a terribly tattered rag.<p>
<p>Burned and worn down over a span of time untold, the hint of an impression once made by the engraving of an old sealing stone can be seen, but it is no longer legible.<p>
<p>And yet a lingering magic recalls something familiar. As if the impressed seal is being held intact by someone in mortal fear of the light's annulment.<p>
<p>[1000009] A finely-crafted streamlined arrowhead.<p>
<p>Used by sellswords of the Fellowship.<p>
<p>Said to be the choice weapon of the Monster, an inhuman assassin. A single word is written on each arrow, and when an arrow deals a death blow, the word becomes the epitaph of the fallen.<p>
<p>To this day, the Monster lurks somewhere, unseen and unknown.<p>
<p>[1000010] An invitation from the traitor, sealed with the stamp of an assassin's contract.<p>
<p>Inside the envelope, a single folded page contains a short message.<p>
<p>"When the Nightlord nears, meet at the Roundtable."<p>
<p>The Monster was aware of a looming threat, and welcomed the assassin Ironeye.<p>
<p>[1000011] A fragment of the spear of Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow. Imbued with holy essence through battles in Limveld.<p>
<p>Can briefly, and only with very limited potency, grant its power to other armaments.<p>
<p>When Those Who Live in Death are felled by the Order, they will never rise again.<p>
<p>[1000012] A doll that appears to have been adored by a young child. The doll's rough cloth is stained with rotting flesh and blood.<p>
<p>Worn thin, as if it were held tightly all too often.<p>
<p>[1000013] A stone stake that opens a sealed-away lock.<p>
<p>Crafted by an ancient civilization and claimed from a Guardian Golem.<p>
<p>Still imbued with an old yet fading magic. Can open locks sealed in a similar manner to the golem.<p>
<p>[1000014] Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west.<p>
<p>An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus.<p>
<p>"The blades shared an identical engraving. A symbol of the sorcery of a distant land. A script put down in blood."<p>
<p>[1000015] A brooch imbued with potent magic, made from the blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>At first, this magic brooch, with its aura of unknowable power, was intended as a ceremonial tool to calm violent winds. But the war, for better or worse, demanded that it be employed otherwise, as a magic artifact to bring a swift end to the conflict.<p>
<p>[1000016] A blade fragment imbued with the power of Night. Crystals have formed on the broken edge.<p>
<p>The dark substance slowly spreads, as if to restore the lost portion of the blade, or to sharpen the existing blade beyond its natural properties.<p>
<p>[1000017] Power of Night that failed to acquire a host.<p>
<p>Droplets that sought to intermingle, and gathered in anticipation of a fitting host's welcome, only to be abandoned.<p>
<p>Desire finds its way through a back door, and longing reveals one's true nature. Little doll, how long can you continue to resist?<p>
<p>[1000018] With its pin repaired, this earring has been fully restored.<p>
<p>Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light.<p>
<p>Closely resembles one owned by the Wylder.<p>
<p>[1000019] Iron coins of a faraway land received from the Wylder.<p>
<p>A nomadic tribe used these coins in trades with settled tribes to purchase supplies to support their isolated lifestyle.<p>
<p>These coins, produced from the Wylder's pocket, are icily cold.<p>
<p>[1000020] A hand-crafted charm that is somehow unsettling. A gift from the apparitional merchant.<p>
<p>Crafted in an unrehearsed, imitative manner, judging by the frayed fabric and numerous loose strings.<p>
<p>Yet a charm is a charm, no matter the appearance.<p>
<p>[1000021] A dubious ledger used by a merchant, filled to the margins with detailed records of transactions.<p>
<p>A recent bold entry stands out.<p>
<p>"Ancient annals - Conveyed to a demon"<p>
<p>[1000022] A torn magic-warding braided cord. Worn by warriors for good luck on the eve of battle.<p>
<p>The distinctive stone clasp suggests that it belonged to glory-seeking pirates.<p>
<p>The legends surrounding the competing seafaring factions, who divided the seas into east and west, have been spoken of for generations in places near and far.<p>
<p>[1000024] A necklace made from a thick rugged claw, with a shining black luster that instils fear in any who gaze upon it. Long ago, the Raider fought the king of the archipelago forest. He grappled the hulking beast with his iron grip, and flung him away, proving his strength. He claimed the king's broken claw as a trophy and testament to his victory.<p>
<p>For a time, the Raider devoted himself to exploits on the high seas, but he tired of the unending struggle that never seemed to determine a clear victor. And so, he delivered the claw to his arch nemesis as an invitation to duel to the death.<p>
<p>[1000025] A coin from a former age received from a burly man. Treasure chests, brimming with such coins, are the stuff of pirates' dreams.<p>
<p>Originally minted with imprints on both sides, the ornamentation has long since vanished owing to the covetous rubbing of thick-knuckled fingers.<p>
<p>The coin recalls the man's worldly wisdom.<p>
<p>"It's your journey. Take all the paths you like."<p>
<p>[1000026] A medal adorning a doll resembling a young girl. An extra decoration for the Revenant's garb.<p>
<p>The silver shines with a brilliance that is both ceremonial and dignified.<p>
<p>It recalls the girl's words.<p>
<p>"With strength comes the burden of duty."<p>
<p>[1000027] Flatbread with a rich aroma offered by the Wylder.<p>
<p>The traditional food of a nomadic tribe from a distant, vast grassland, passed down from mother to son.<p>
<p>"I know this.<p>
<p>The gently sweet and salty<p>
<p>flavor of this pita."<p>
<p>[1000028] Annals detailing the histories of certain cursed weapons speak of a conflict far to the west.<p>
<p>An account mentions one such accursed weapon called an Ictarus.<p>
<p>"The blade leaves a wound that can never heal, owing to an ancient curse with the power to twist life. A frightful weapon concocted by a master of curses, under contract to an army determined to achieve victory."<p>
<p>[1000030] A scrap of paper with a note on the White Horn, part of a legend of the coastal waters, written by a certain first mate.<p>
<p>"Two seafarers, one from the west and the other from the east, were once locked in a fierce competition for influence. The White Horn ruled the west waters, while the Black Claw presided over the eastern seas.<p>
<p>Upon the shore did they contend for seven days and seven nights to see which was the stronger. While each fought bravely, a clear victor felt undeterminable."<p>
<p>[1000031] An iron coin imbued with a small blessing by the priestess. Emits a faint warmth.<p>
<p>The blessing would surely become a beacon to guide its bearer to its former owner.<p>
<p>That it might save the dear brother who would be facing death in the world outside. With that wish, so was it endowed. To one who could not be said to be truly alive, but all the same was surely called a friend.<p>
<p>[1000032] A cracked brooch, bereft of its former magic. A blood magic crystal received from the Recluse.<p>
<p>This brooch powered the accursed Ictarus weapons that once robbed the Pinionfolk of flight.<p>
<p>The Guardian smashed the jewel at the core of this magic implement. To think it was once a mere ceremonial tool to calm violent winds.<p>
<p>[1000033] A small key featuring fine ornamentation. A fine work of craft made by Gillian, the Duchess' steward and de facto patron.<p>
<p>The Duchess once lived under the Viscount's roof, where she applied herself as a virtuous thief. She locked the tools of her trade inside a box of prized possessions, which she hid in a dim cellar.<p>
<p>This practice has not changed since coming to the Roundtable Hold. She yet keeps her secrets safe from prying eyes, concealing them in darkened corners.<p>
<p>[1000034] A scrap of paper detailing the "New Night" written in the tongue of an ancient people. The passage, torn from its former binding, reads:<p>
<p>"The Priestess is the very cornerstone of the Roundtable—indispensable. Should the Nightlord fall, the Roundtable too will crumble, as their fates are together bound.<p>
<p>Yet should the Roundtable be remade, perhaps the Priestess may be emancipated from her bindings.<p>
<p>This might be done upon the falling of the "New Night," should the Lord's power be lost. And if so..."<p>
<p>[1000035] A single earring belonging to the Wylder. Rusted and encrusted with grime.<p>
<p>Such ornaments were worn for generations by a distant tribe. They are delicately embellished to cast a pattern when held up to light.<p>
<p>This appears to be one of a pair.<p>
<p>[1000036] A disturbing stone with a distinct lifelessness.<p>
<p>The bone of an outer god with the power to expunge divine essence, but that can also be destroyed by the same essence.<p>
<p>The choice was left to the witch. As per the wishes of the one who bestowed it.<p>
<p>[1000100] A thing with the properties of a Great Rune harbored by the Primordial Nightlord.<p>
<p>The cutting-gifted tribe anticipated the coming night, and spent many a moon planning its prevention, concluding that their only chance at success was to cheat a god.<p>
<p>They had glimpsed what they should not; the very sin of the Erdtree. For their trespass, so were they punished.<p>
<p>[1000101] The qualities of the Nightlord, bearing the manifest potential to alter fate itself.<p>
<p>The light dimly reveals the contours—of a greater being that lies beyond the Nightlord.<p>
